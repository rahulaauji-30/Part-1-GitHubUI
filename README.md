# Simple Interest Calculator

Welcome to the Simple Interest Calculator project! This repository hosts a basic Python script that calculates simple interest. It is part of our journey as a micro-finance startup to gradually transition from SVN to Git and embrace open-source best practices.

## Project Description

This project calculates the simple interest using the formula:

\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

- **P** = Principal Amount
- **R** = Rate of Interest (per year)
- **T** = Time (in years)

This tool is designed to help low-income individuals understand and calculate simple interest on their loans or savings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulaauji-30/Part-1-GitHubUI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Part-1-GitHubUI
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python simple_interest.py
   ```

### Usage

The script will prompt you to enter the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period, then it will output the simple interest.

Example:

```bash
A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.
Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r
Copied!
